Description: This package was prepared for solving inverse problem of electrical
    impedance tomography. This version of the software was intended for 64 electrode
    system. Parallel computing was introduced. The boundary of subcutaneous fat and
    anisotropic conductivities are estimated simultaniously. Image enhancement was
    implemented.
